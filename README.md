# AppendicitisDiagnosisModel
A binary classification algorithm which takes in several clinical data inputs to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis in children. Training and testing data was obtained from the Children’s Hospital St. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany and repurposed into a .csv file, which I downloaded off Kaggle.
